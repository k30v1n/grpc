# gRPC test project
In this project I'm doing some tests with this technology.

## Nuget Package info
https://github.com/grpc/grpc-dotnet#available-now-on-net-core-30
AspNetCore 3.0 packages
gRPC functionality for .NET Core 3.0 includes:

- Grpc.AspNetCore – An ASP.NET Core framework for hosting gRPC services. gRPC on ASP.NET Core integrates with standard ASP.NET Core features like logging, dependency injection (DI), authentication and authorization.
- Grpc.Net.Client – A gRPC client for .NET Core that builds upon the familiar HttpClient. The client uses new HTTP/2 functionality in .NET Core.
- Grpc.Net.ClientFactory – gRPC client integration with HttpClientFactory. The client factory allows gRPC clients to be centrally configured and injected into your app with DI.
